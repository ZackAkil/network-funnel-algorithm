# Network Funnel Algorithm
Algorithm for evaluating funnelling points in a network of nodes.

## Purpose and Inspiration
This algorithm will be able to calculate which nodes in a network will be the busiest based solely on network structure. Its inspired by using the London tube and seeing how different volumes of people get on and off and stops and seeing how the line maps indicate which stops connect to which other network lines.
